# FORECAST Tertiary
This repository contains code extensions to the FORECAST Simulation platform (https://www.forecast-model.eu/forecast-en/index.php).  
This code was developed during the H2020 project newTRENDs.  
It works as a pre-process to the FORECAST simulation and adjusts the internal database in order to model new trends of digitalization.  
E.g. teleworking and its impact on office space and energy demand in the tertiary sector was not part of FORECAST before, but can now be added to the model by this pre-process and its according assumptions.
