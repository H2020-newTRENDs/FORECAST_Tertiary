# FORECAST Tertiary
## Code
This repository contains code extensions to the FORECAST Simulation platform (https://www.forecast-model.eu/forecast-en/index.php).  
This code was developed during the H2020 project newTRENDs.  
It works as a pre-process to the FORECAST simulation and adjusts the internal database in order to model new trends of digitalization.  
E.g. teleworking and its impact on office space and energy demand in the tertiary sector was not part of FORECAST before, but can now be added to the model by this pre-process and its according assumptions.  

## Data  
Investments as result of the FORECAST simulation. Overnight investments for building components and heating systems, without O&M. Real prices 2019.  
Final energy demand (FED) of the tertiary sector as result of the FORECAST simulation. Per country and energy carrier in TWh.  
Teleworking: Average share of employment in teleworking, per country. Calculated by FORECAST extension.
